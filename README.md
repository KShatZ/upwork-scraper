# What is this project?
This is a webscraper that I built to assist with the sales proccess when I was working as a freelancer on a site called Upwork. I got annoyed of having to constantly check on the job posting pages to see if someone had posted a new opportunity. So I decided to code this project in order to be notified if new jobs were posted and save me ALOT of time in order to focus on service delivery for my clients. 

The scraper uses Python's BeautifulSoup library to parse out important information from a job boards RSS feed into a slack message. These slack messages are then sent to a specific channel I created for the bot, and I would get notified every 5 minutes if messages were sent.
